Recently my partner and I were tasked with finding the best way for Microsoft to enter the movie streaming and production space.  This industry has exploded recently as shown by Prime Video, Disney +, Hulu, and many other similar companies.

Using data from several different resources, most notably IMDB, we came to a series of conclusions on how to maximize revenue and ratings when entering this turbulent market.

**Data Cleaning**:

For the data for this project, we were given a large amount ( hundreds of thousands of rows) of data on different movies, individuals in the film industry, and studios.  After some cleaning and adjusting, we created a SQL database to store all of this data so we could pull it up at will.  

The advantage to this is that we can pick and choose columns at will to compare and contrast!  For example, I can explore foreign revenue performance of directors born between 1971 and 1976, something I would not be able to do using the data sheets independent of each other.

Here's an example of some of the data we worked with:

**Genre Seasonality**:

The first variable I explored was genre.  Genres perform differently, and one thing I was especially curious about was how seasonality relates to these different genres.  Which months are the best for the distinct genres?  After some data cleaning and compiling, I had a file that had laid out genre by genre, how much revenue each genre generated by month over the past ten years.  If this sounds confusing, I have a visual below.

From there, I gathered the top six genres by revenue.  Listed from most to least revenue, they are Action, Adventure, Drama, Comedy, Documentary, and Biography.  Next I started looking at when revenue spiked (both worldwide and domestic) for each genre.  Below is the final chart.  As you can see, each genre has 2-3 months where revenue spikes significantly.  This is likely when the market and demand for these movies is highest.  Using this information, Microsoft can create a release schedule for its top movies in each genre!  The gross revenue figures (Y axis) are shown in billions of dollars, and the pink signifies worldwide gross, while the blue signifies domestic gross.

**Ratings**:

I explored ratings next. Now that we had some ideas on how to generate revenue more effectively (my partner did some research on this as well), I wanted to dive into keeping ratings high.  While revenue and profit are important, ratings keep customer loyalty.  If your movies are badly rated, it hurts publicity and will lead to customers dropping your platform.  

I explored the following variables:
* Budget
* Runtime
* Studio
* Genre
* Director
Below, I’ll expand on my findings:

**Budget**:

Surprisingly, there’s not much correlation between budget and ratings.  This is likely due to small Art House studios making shoestring budget films that rate highly.  The tradeoff here is that the small Art House studios don’t often generate that much revenue.  That said, I would advise Microsoft to work with these studios as well as the larger ones as these smaller, more artistically focused studios can lead to better ratings.

**Runtime**:

Runtime correlates fairly highly with ratings success.  While it’s not always appropriate to drag out your films, an extra half hour on a high quality film certainly can’t hurt!

**Studio**:

This is where some of the more serious analysis started.  As we noted above, a high budget does not equal a stellar rating.  As such, if we’re looking for studios to work with or acquire, we should be searching for studios with experience (not one hit wonders) that are able to put out high quality films on a reasonable budget.  With the data I collected, I had a clean list of 71 studios to go through.  

I created a scatter plot showing average rating on the y axis, average budget on the x axis, average domestic gross as dot size, and number of movies on the color scale (high number being lighter).  We identified the following studios as promising partners due to their modest budgets, experience with multiple highly regarded films, and reasonable high revenue potential.

The following studios (with some of their more well known movies) stood out: 
* **MBox** - *Girl with Dragon Tattoo and Ida*
* **Neon** - *I, Tonya*
* **Lantern Entertainment** (previously known as Weinstein company) - *The King’s Speech, Django Unchained*
* **TriS** - *John Wick, Looper*

**Genre**:

Next we took a look at genres.  From the boxplot below, it seems that a small emphasis on putting out dramas and biography films may be to our advantage in terms of ratings!

**Director**:

Lastly we looked at directors.  Here, we took a similar approach to the studio question.  Who has experience?  Who brings in above average revenue?  Who can create well rated movies on below average budgets?  I created a scatterplot tracking the following:
* Average Rating on the Y axis
* Total Domestic Gross on the X axis
* Average Budget on the color scale

With these criteria, we can identify which directors create excellent movies on medium/low budgets (while still bringing in high revenue).  For this chart, I only pulled in the top 100 directors in terms of total domestic gross.  I think we can afford to be a bit selective here!

With the above chart, we identified the following directors with one of their most well known movies:
* **Marilyn Barnes** - *Beauty and the Beast*
* **Tim Miller** - *Deadpool*
* **Martin Scoresese** - *The Wolf of Wall Street*


**Further Work To Do**:

Given more time on this project, I would have loved to attempt to create a tool that would put together a dream team for specific movies.  Using data we can investigate which directors, actors, producers, and writers work the best together.  With this data laid out, we can suggest teams to assemble when making, for example, a small budget biography film.

**Conclusion**:

These were my main takeaways from this project:

First, It would be incredibly helpful to time movie releases for the correct month.  If you start building up a queue of movies to release in the future, wait until November to release your drama flick!  That’s when the demand is the highest.  For your comedy films, May and December seem to be the best months.  You can refer back to my previous chart to see ideal release times for all the top genres.

Second, there are ways to pursue high ratings for your films without blowing out the budget.  It’s important to have good ratings.  No one would use Netflix, for example, if all their movies were subpar!  In the paragraphs above, I identified certain studios and directors that have consistently put out above average films in terms of ratings without using an extraordinarily large budget. 

Thank you for your time reading this, and please let me know if you have any feedback on the project!
